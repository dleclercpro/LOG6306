### Project Title
Impact of Typing on Code Smells: A Comparison Between Javascript and Typescript Projects

### Smell Detectors
- SonarQube
- JSNose

## Validity Threats
- Not using a compiler may be compensated by increasingly intelligent IDEs, which can provide static code analysis on-the-fly.
- Code smells may be a symptom of a hidden variable (e.g. community smells), which is responsible for fault-proneness of code.

## Questions
- Does SonarQube analyze the entire commit history? If so, does it keep track of issues which existed at some point, but were then removed? It seems as though SonarQube only reports issues present in the current state of a project. It also informs the user wrt. when said issues were introduced in their current form. The problem is: those issues could have been introduced earlier, yet the last modification involving it is identified as the time where it was introduced. Another problem is: if an issue existed at some point, but was removed, it never shows up in SonarQube's analysis.
- Which code smells can SonarQube identify?
- What is the detection performance of SonarQube?
- Can I add a custom set of rules allowing SonarQube to detect more smells? How to determine performance then?
